# Welcome to my dice game! The name of the game is double down and we will be playing against the computer in a game of luck! The object of the game is to get a specific dice combination in order to win the round. There are six rounds and in each one, you (and the computer) are afforded the opportunity to double your score if you won the round. But heres the catch, if you choose to double your score and you lose the round, your opponent will get the double points and you will get none. This will continue for six rounds until we have a player with a higher score. At that point, a game of Pig will begin where each player will roll a certain number of dice and add up the total until someone reaches a score of 100. The winner of the six rounds will play pig with 6 dice and the loser will play with only 5. All ties go to the player.
